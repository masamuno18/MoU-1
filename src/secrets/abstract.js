  structures that formulate physical laws rest simple but deep nuggets of truth. It\
  is these simple truths, and not the complicated technical details, that scientists \
  strive for when uncovering the laws of nature. Fortunately, these core ideas can often \
  be illustrated with simple mathematical puzzles. In this talk I discuss examples of these \
  simple mathematical puzzles and show how they can shed light on some of the deepest \
  concepts in physics.  Audience will be asked to participate in solving the puzzles!  \
  (based on my book ``Puzzles to Unravel the Universe'' which is designed for the general \
  public, and does not require extensive background in mathematics or physics—just a sense of curiosity!"

export const abstractJS = "This lecture will present a nontechnical overview of some of the \
  key developments in string theory that took place in the 20th century. Beginning in the \
  late 1960s, string theoryarose out of an attempt to develop a theory of the strong nuclear \
  force. The initial string theory was clearly unrealistic because it did not contain fermions. \
  In 1971 another string theory, containing fermions, was introduced by Ramond, Neveu, and me. \
  It led to the discovery of a new type of symmetry that relates bosons and fermions, which was \
  called supersymmetry.(Supersymmetry was independently discovered by Soviet scientists at about \
  the same time.) Supersymmetric string theories were later called superstring theories. By 1974 the \
  correct theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD, was well established, and string theory was abandoned \
  by all but a few people. In 1974 Joel Scherk and I realized that superstring theory necessarily contains \
  gravity. This led us to propose that, instead of describing the strong nuclear force, it could provide a \
  unified quantum theory of all fundamental forces. Following discoveries by Michael Green and me in 1984, \
  as well as subsequent discoveries by others, the subject suddenly became mainstream, which it has remained \
  ever since. Progress then became much more rapid. I will summarize some of the highlights prior to the year \
  2000 and leave the more recent developments for subsequent speakers."

export const abstractJM = "Black holes are fascinating objects where spacetime is deformed in a \
  significant way. After reviewing some clasical aspects of black holes, we discuss the phenomenon \
  of Hawking radiation and the puzzles that it raises. We will then introduce an idea for describing \
  spacetime where some of the dimensions are emergent and we get an interesting relation between \
  black holes and more conventional quantum systems. "

export const abstractEW = "Since it is difficult to understand gravity at the quantum level, physicists \
  have sought understanding from simpler models in low dimensions. In this talk, I will explain how a simple \
  model of quantum gravity in two dimensions leads to the study of the volumes of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces."

export const abstractAA = "Black Holes, Big Bang and Gravitational Waves now appear as compelling – even \
obvious – consequences of general relativity. This wide-spread acceptance is reflected in the numerous recent \
Nobel prizes, particularly the 2018 prize for gravitational waves and 2020 prize for black holes. Therefore \
it may seem surprising that none of these ideas were readily accepted. Not only was there considerable debate, \
but in fact leading figures were often arguing on what turned out to be the ‘wrong side’ of history. These developments \
provide excellent lessons for younger researchers on how science unfolds. Paradigm shifts in science occur when younger \
researchers have the courage not to accept ideas merely because they are mainstream; patience to systematically develop \
novel avenues they deeply believe in; and maturity to accept that a variety of factors – not all logical or even science \
related – can drive or slowdown scientific progress."
